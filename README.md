# DayPlannerTaeHW

Made a Day planner using HTML, CSS, jQuery amd used Moment js to have updatable times. Also added custom google fonts.

Made 3 columns, 1 for the hours in a business day, one for the text area to fill out and then finally a button that will save all of the text you entered into the text area.

Used moment js to have the date in the header update everyday and also is used to have the day planner change colors based on what timne of the day it is. Past, present and future all presenting differents colors as it goes by that particular time of the day.
